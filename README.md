# 🎮 algo-arcade  
**A playful collection of algorithms, data structures, and interview problem solutions — leveled up one game at a time.**

## 🕹️ Welcome to the Arcade  
This repo is my personal playground for studying algorithms and sharpening coding interview skills.  
Each problem is a “game,” each solution an “upgrade,” and each concept a new “level unlocked.”

## 🧩 What’s Inside
- 🎯 **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, greedy, DP, graph algorithms, and more  
- 🧱 **Data Structures:** Stacks, queues, heaps, trees, tries, linked lists  
- 🧠 **Interview Problems:** LeetCode, HackerRank, custom problems  
- 📝 **Notes & Patterns:** Big-O, templates, common strategies  
- 🧪 **Implementations:** C#, Java, JS, Go, Python, clean and tested  

## 🏆 Level System (Optional Fun)
- 🟢 **Level 1:** Easy problems  
- 🟡 **Level 2:** Medium problems  
- 🔴 **Boss Level:** Hard problems  
- 🟣 **Secret Levels:** Beautiful tricks, optimizations, mind-benders

## 🔧 Tools & Rules
- Write clean code  
- Add explanations when needed  
- Track time & space complexity  
- Practice revisiting older “games” to master them  

## 🚀 Goal  
Become interview-ready while keeping learning fun, creative, and sustainable.
